# chess
Same as the other chess correspndence program except it can be run over discord as a bot.
Can also be used to have discord users play chess correspondence with each other.
If you want to run it, put your own bot token in the the corresponding line of code.
There is a help function which tells you the commands for the bot with "!help".
