# chess
I am making a proof of concept of a way to send binary data over a chess correspondence conversation, written in python.
  The encryption function uses the python chess library, which can be found here: https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess.
  Essentially each move will send one binary digit, so you can send relevant information, it would just take a very very long time.
  Right now this is just a proof of concept, but if I am board enough or if this somehow gets enough attention I may make a full-blown app out of this.
  Born out of my interest in sending data over normal forms of communication and in using binary digits for data exfiltration.
